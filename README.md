# Fundamentals

A collection of concepts learned throughout my computer science education. This repository will be continually updating as interests progress.

In this repository, I prioritize myself to understand these concepts, hence there may not be absolute "clean" implementations (i.e. minimal lines of code) of the code I provided here.

### Conceptual ADTs [Python]
Known abstract data types,  typically used in further theory in computer science. After not touching python for the intended computer science use for approximately 12 months, re-implementing these ADTs were quite fun to despite myself dusting off some rust. Unit tests were conducted to ensure that the behaviour of these ADTs were stable.

### Sorts [Python]
A collection of popular sorts that orders a list of comparable objects from smallest to largest; introduction to Big-Oh notation

### Design Patterns [Java]
A collection of design patterns used in a software engineering basis. The collection as the time I am writing this (September 2018) only consists of design patterns taught in the [Software Design](https://utsc.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/cscb07h3) course


### SQL [Jupyter and SQL]
A wild bundle of items within SQL. SQL was taught in the [Business Data Analytics](https://utsc.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/mgod30h3) course and the [Introduction to Databases and Web Applications](https://utsc.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/cscb20h3) course. Foundationally, relational algebra is included. Will be revisiting when time is not scarce. I'm putting this on my github as a form of committing to brush up on SQL.

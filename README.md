# Fundamentals

A collection of concepts learned throughout my computer science education. This repository will be continually updating as interests progress.

In this repository, I prioritize myself to understand these concepts, hence there may not be absolute "clean" implementations (i.e. minimal lines of code) of the code I provided here.

### [Conceptual ADTs [Python]](./conceptualADTs)
Known abstract data types,  typically used in further theory in computer science. After not touching python for the intended computer science use for approximately 12 months, re-implementing these ADTs were quite fun to despite myself dusting off some rust. Unit tests were conducted to ensure that the behaviour of these ADTs were stable.

### [Sorts [Python]](./sorts)
A collection of popular sorts that orders a list of comparable objects from smallest to largest; introduction to Big-Oh notation

### [Design Patterns [Java]](./design)
A collection of design concepts (including SOLID and Agile Methodology) and design patterns used in a software engineering basis. The collection of design patterns consists of design patterns taught in the [Software Design](https://utsc.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/cscb07h3) course and the [Introduction to Software Engineering](https://github.com/ThierrySans/CSCC01) course


### [SQL [Python and SQL]](./SQL)
A collection of items pertaining to SQL, Relational Algebra, and common statistical definitions for the field of Data Science. SQL was taught in the [Business Data Analytics](https://utsc.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/mgod30h3) course and the [Introduction to Databases and Web Applications](https://utsc.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/cscb20h3) course.

### [Python Imports](./pythonImports)
A basic how-to import guide in Python

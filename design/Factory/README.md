# Factory Design Pattern
A descriptive abstraction of a constructor, allowing multiple ways to instantiate an object without guessing the constructor's purpose

### Highlights:
* Factory methods are static, meaning that an instantiation of the class is not needed
* Factory methods return the instance of the class that the method is in
* Factory methods provide description as to how an object is created; eventually invoking the private constructor(s)
